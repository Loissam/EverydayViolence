Her work is the excess flesh she does not want on her body.  \n Flesh to her is a malleable substance and she’s utterly fascinated by its violent, grotesque carnality that fuels her work. \n She feels that the hand of the artist is indeed as violent as the hand of the butcher. As delicate as the hand of a seamstress and as intimate as the hand of the surgeon."
