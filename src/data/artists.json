            "statement": "The involvement of human touch means the photographer moves from being passive to the image, to being an active participant in the photograph, contextualising lived experience into a medium usually limited only by its capacity to record a moment. Questioning domesticity in the everyday and the repetition of regular tasks, her work examines the impact these processes have on the self during quarantine. Through the pages we delve into notion of the unknown through forty distinct experiments. The viewer is invited to share in internal conversations and thoughts, creating a conversation between the order and chaos that is being reflected upon. Fear merges written and photographic objects which offer a more personalised insight into the artists vision. She is selective in this process and is in control of what she reveals and what remains hidden to the viewer. "

Jess knows that she has one thing in mind- flesh. Her work is the excess flesh she does not want on her body.  \n Flesh to her is a malleable substance and sheâ€™s utterly fascinated by its violent, grotesque carnality that fuels her work. \n She feels that the hand of the artist is indeed as violent as the hand of the butcher. As delicate as the hand of a seamstress and as intimate as the hand of the surgeon."
