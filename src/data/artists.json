Lockdowns and quarantines have wrapped us up tightly, they’ve left us to reflect on ourselves; Behind closed doors and with no-one else to influence us. Our spaces can reflect who we are, we change our surroundings to suit us, but does that answer the question?"

            "statement": "Jess' practice is spontaneous. She wakes up in the morning, not knowing where her work shall lead her throughout the day. Jess knows that she has one thing in mind- flesh. Her work is the excess flesh she does not want on her body.  \n Flesh to her is a malleable substance and she’s utterly fascinated by its violent, grotesque carnality that fuels her work. \n She feels that the hand of the artist is indeed as violent as the hand of the butcher. As delicate as the hand of a seamstress and as intimate as the hand of the surgeon."
